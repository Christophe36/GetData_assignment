include library : 

    data.table  : very fast package to read table.

Assuming that data are already on your working directory.

```

1a) Import train and test data 

```
    function : fread() : reads a data table 

               as.data.frame() : coerce data set type from "data.table" "data.frame" 

               to data frame.
```               

1b)  merging train and test data sets 
```

    function rbind() : binds train and test data sets with respect to rows 

    and leads to Dataset data frame.
```

2)  Descriptive Activities  names 

```


read activity label in file  "activity_labels.txt"

```

3) Extract means and Standard deviations of each measurement

```

    "features.txt" : a text file data of features labels.

    Mean or mean: features means 

    SD or Sd : features standard deviation

   -function : 

               fread (): reads features.txt data file

               grep () : gets regular expression  (mean and Sd ) index from features vector extracted 
               from features.txt

               gsub () : removes special characters from above selected features names 

               cbind () : creates a new dataset comprise of Means and SD 
               
```

4) Labelling  data set 

```

 - get subject and activity vectors from given files (subject_train.tx, Y_train.txt,subject_test.txt, Y_train,Y_test)

 - bind columnwise subject and activity to the above dataset with cbind ()

```

5) DATA SET WITH AVERAGE OF EACH VARIABLE OF EACH ACTIVITY AND EACH SUBJECT 

```
turn Activities  feature to a factor variable and coerces DataSet1 to a data frame class
 DataSet1 is comprised of :
 
                         6 activities times 30 subjects = 180 rows 

                         88 means and SD features
```
